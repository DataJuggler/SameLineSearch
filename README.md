# SameLineSearch
This simple Windows Forms .Net 5 project recursively searches a given directory, for a set of search terms that all must exist in the same line for it be counted.

To run this program after cloning
1. Start Program
2. Browse for top level of your project
3. Entension was hard code for version one ".cs";. I will make this a control as soon as I get some time. You can change this in the SearchButton_Click event.
4. Type in one or more search terms separated by a space.

This program already helped me, because I was looking for how to return a JSon message so I searched for:
return new json

Visual Studio search would have turned up 100's of results on my solution for any of the above. Commbined into one search, I found 6 exammples to look at.

I find this to be a valuable search, I made adopt this into Visual Studio, as Visual Studio search is bad on a web project with libraries imported.
